In this project, I have downloaded the given dataset of hotel bookings (CSV file) to use it as a pandas dataframe using pandas library of Python. I have came to know more details about the datset by using df.info() method. I have checked the number of data types in the dataset using value_counts() method. If any column of the dataset has highest missing values, the respective coulmn should be removed using drop() method. I have performed data wrangling using value_counts() method and sort_values() method to sort the accordingly. Fianlly, the Vizualization is done in a structured way while following the \"UBM\"\n",
